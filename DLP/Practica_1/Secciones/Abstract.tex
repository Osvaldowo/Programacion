The practice focuses on the use of Hardware Description Languages (VHDL and Verilog) to implement and simulate digital circuits on an FPGA development board. Both combinational and sequential circuits are developed: basic logic functions, an 8-bit register based on D flip-flops, a 4-bit up/down binary counter with a 7-segment display output, and sound generators. Finally, all the modules are integrated into a Top Level Design (TLD), which combines every function into a single project. The goal is to help students become familiar with the complete digital design flow: programming, simulation, implementation, and testing on real hardware.
